# Release notes

What changed in each version of Naget Agent, newest first. The app shows these in Settings → General →
Release notes, and says what is new after it updates.

## 0.6.1 · 31 October 2026

Memory that finds by meaning and keeps itself tidy, one search for everything, and these release notes.

- **Memory** is written by agents when you ask them to remember something or they learn something lasting,
  no longer after every reply. A note can be true only until a date, and agents can correct one in place.
  They start with the notes that bear on what you asked, found by their words and, once you turn on
  search by meaning in Settings → Memory, by what they mean, with LightOn's mDenseOn model on your own
  computer: on a GPU, or on the CPU in about 1.4 GB, only while needed.
- Each night the helper model tidies memory up: it merges notes that say the same thing, dates the ones
  true only for a while and, once a place's notes no longer fit, sums them up in topics and a short
  profile agents get first. Every change can be undone. Settings shows when each note was last needed
  and suggests removing the ones no agent needed for months.
- **Search everything**: Ctrl+K (⌘K on a Mac), or Search in the sidebar, finds pages, every setting,
  sessions and what was said in them, memory notes, apps, scheduled tasks, assistants, skills, pages,
  connections, themes and files, as you type. Opening a result goes where it is: a setting opens its page
  and points at it, a message opens its session at the words. With search by meaning on, things match
  what they mean too, in nine languages.
- **Release notes** for every version, here and from the search box; after an update a note says what
  is new.
- A file opened from a session shows in a dialog over the conversation, which stays where it was. The
  editor fits a phone, and the dark editor uses the app's own colours.
- The start page has one quiet row under the message box (the agent, its model, the folder, the
  assistant), with the rest under Options, and opens with what you picked there last, on any device.
- Settings on wide screens: a tab per group, one scroll, smaller theme cards.
- Sessions open at once, without a fade. A session's … menu shows the main things first and the rest in
  three submenus. A scheduled run's message shows as one line, replies keep their line breaks, and the
  memory chip under a reply shows what changed word by word.
- Apps: ask for changes after a run and the agent hands in the whole updated result; a template's page
  picks the reasoning effort too.
- The sources under a reply include what Claude Code and Codex searched and read with their own web
  tools, and agents know which Pages tool fits what.
- On phones: the usage-limit banner fits, the message box's pickers and the background tasks span the
  screen, and the account buttons wrap under the name.
- Fixed: the browser's … menu opens again after full screen, and nothing in the sidebar shows through the
  full-screen browser.

## 0.6.0 · 31 October 2026

Help with anything: Naget Agent grows from a harness for coding agents into an assistant for any task.

- Every agent gets web search (Naget Search by default) and a browser you can watch and take over.
- Memory of you, each project and each session; documents in and out; connected apps with a vault for
  keys; child sessions; pages and apps you keep; skills; voice; a second opinion; spending caps.
- Custom gets a harness that makes any model work like Claude Code and Codex, Auto mode, fork, edit from
  here and /goal.
- Assistants and task folders for work that is not code; scheduled tasks from chat, with watchers and run
  history.

## 0.5.3 · 31 October 2026

Starts with the computer, and a published Docker image.

- Settings → General: "Start when this computer starts", on by default, for a service of your user, a
  system service or Docker's restart policy. A copy started by hand from a git clone sets up its user
  service the first time it runs.
- Docker: the image is built for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64 and published as nagetai/naget-agent;
  compose pulls it, or builds it here with your own user ids. Its copy of the app updates from the
  public repository.

## 0.5.2 · 31 October 2026

Hugging Face search, and clearer model setup.

- Search Hugging Face by name: each model's maker, size, format (GGUF for Ollama, safetensors for vLLM),
  downloads, likes and date, with a first verdict on how it runs here. Filters and an order; Check shows
  the exact fit, and Install is in the row.
- This computer at a glance: graphics, memory and disk, Ollama and vLLM, and how big a model fits; in the
  tour and in Settings → Models.
- OpenRouter: a "Connected" row, your models listed compactly, and filters that wrap.

## 0.5.1 · 31 October 2026

A mark of its own, and a richer OpenRouter search.

- The new mark: Naget's n holding a gold nugget, on the favicon, the app icons and the loader, arriving
  the way it does in the film.
- OpenRouter search shows each model's maker, context, longest reply, prices, release month and
  description, with badges for new, free, reasoning, images and models without native tool calls.
  Filters and an order; browsing works without a query.

## 0.5.0 · 31 October 2026

Naget Agent, a tour that adapts to what you use, and blurred backdrops.

- The app is renamed Naget Agent, a self-hosted agent harness; installs from before keep their service,
  data folder and settings. The built-in agent is called Custom.
- The welcome tour asks what you want to use (Claude Code, Codex, models through OpenRouter or on this
  computer, other agents), sets each up in place, and words the rest of the tour for those.
- Dialogs, the drawer, the palette and viewers blur the page behind them.
- The history no longer jumps while you type a message of several lines.

## 0.4.1 · 31 October 2026

Console (now Custom) uses Codex's MCP servers too, from ~/.codex/config.toml, beside Claude Code's and the
project's.

## 0.4.0 · 31 October 2026

Commit, branches and stashes on the Git page.

- Pick the files to commit, see each diff in place, discard a file's changes, and commit or commit and
  push. "Write message" drafts the message in the style of the repository's recent commits.
- Switch, create and delete merged branches from the branch name.
- Stash every change and apply it again later; any commit opens to its files and diffs.

## 0.3.2 · 31 October 2026

The sidebar's sessions show the moment it opens.

## 0.3.1 · 31 October 2026

One agent picker on the start page, listing Claude Code, Codex, Console and any agent you added alike.

## 0.3.0 · 31 October 2026

Console, the app's own agent, for any model; models from Hugging Face; agent programs that install
themselves.

- Console (now Custom) works with OpenRouter, Ollama, Hugging Face models served here with vLLM, or any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint: it reads, edits and searches files, runs commands, keeps a plan, loads
  skills and uses MCP servers, asking before edits and commands by mode.
- Settings → Models: an OpenRouter key and pinned models; Ollama and vLLM found by themselves; a model
  from Hugging Face shows first whether and how it runs here, then installs.
- Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenCode and the other agents install by themselves when needed, and stay up
  to date.

## 0.2.1 · 31 October 2026

On phones the drawer fills the screen and each session has a delete button; in a session the
conversation fades out under the header.

## 0.2.0 · 31 October 2026

Updates install themselves; phone layouts, motion and an app-mark loader.

- A copy installed from git checks for a newer version once a day and installs it by itself after 5 hours
  without a message from you (Settings → General), or at once with "Update now", while agents carry on.
- Phones: a compact drawer, and Activity, System, Files and the start page fit the screen.
- Activity starts at the first month with data, and offers to keep Claude Code's conversations past its
  30 days.
- Small motion across the app: icons that answer the pointer, tiles that count up, meters that grow.

## 0.1.0 · 30 October 2026

The first release, as Agent Console: a self-hosted web app that runs the official Claude Code and Codex
on your machine, with one interface for desk and phone: live timelines in plain words, approvals, diffs,
notifications and push, pull requests and reviews, terminal, files, git, notebooks, scheduled tasks,
usage limits, several accounts and machines, and agents that speak ACP.
